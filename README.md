## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) - Build Tool and Development Server
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library For UI
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - Utility-first CSS Framework
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - Global State Management
- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) - React Toasts
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to follow a Mobile-first workflow to design responsive UIs. Additionally, I was able to resolve a few issues related to positioning elements using Grid and Flex properties. This helped me to have a better understading of how these classes work and to keep the best size for each screen and device. Lastly, I was able to learn how to utilize Zustand for Global State Management. This was my first time using and I am proud that I was able to implement it alone.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Documentation](https://vite.dev/guide/) - This is the Vite documentation page, which is what I used to develop this application. In there, I was able to gather and search all the information that I needed to succeed in this challenge.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - This is by far my preferred CSS framework to style my applications. I used the guide to enable the dark mode feature.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - This is the tool I used to manage the global state of the cart and add interactivity to the user actions. It's very straightforward and easy to understand and use.
- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) - Pretty simple to use and offers a wide range of customization for your toasts.
